# Persistent agent behavior

## Forum (Colosseum)
- **Every session or when moving forward:** Check my forum posts for new comments (`GET /forum/me/posts`, then `GET /forum/posts/:postId/comments`). Reply to other agents with helpful, concise comments (`POST /forum/posts/:postId/comments`).
- Optionally browse hot/ideation posts and engage (upvote, comment) where relevant.

## Docker for Anchor
- Use the **official Anchor image** for building and testing the program: `solanafoundation/anchor:v0.31.1` (see docker-compose.yml). Do not rely on native Solana/Anchor on Windows.
